excerpt: Simple way how to check key in Object
---

At first you have an Object.
```js
const color = {
  red: "#FF0000"
};
```

You may use `in` and conditional function.
```js
"red" in color;

// with conditional
if ("red" in color) {
  // do something
}
```

Or another way, use `hasOwnProperty()`. 
```js
// with hasOwnProperty
car.hasOwnProperty("red");
```
